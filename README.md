## Description
No-mat-ic is a cutting-edge platform designed to enhance the training experience for athletes in the Jiu-Jitsu community. The application features two main components: the Matchmaker and the OpenMat Finder, which aim to facilitate skill development, community building, and training optimization.

## Features

### Matchmaker
The Matchmaker feature employs advanced algorithms to intelligently pair athletes for practice matches. Users can set preferences, such as skill level, weight class, and experience, to find suitable opponents. The feature offers a dynamic platform where users can preview potential opponents and schedule matches effortlessly. This fosters skill growth and a sense of camaraderie among practitioners.

### OpenMat Finder
The OpenMat Finder tool reimagines training optimization by integrating location data and user-specific filters. It enables users to discover nearby training opportunities based on factors like time availability, skill levels, and gym facilities. The personalized suggestions empower practitioners to fine-tune their training regimens while fostering a stronger sense of community within the broader Jiu-Jitsu ecosystem.

## Technologies Used
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js
- Back-end: Java, Spring Boot
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Geolocation: Google Maps API integration

## Nomatic (Mat)chmaker CLI Application:
The first phase of Nomatic began as a command line application where athletes can manually enter match information, such as athlete name, match belt rank, match weight, time limit, etc. A digital scoreboard would then be the primary interface the user interacts with as the match progresses. The digital scoreboard has a countdown clock as well as buttons to add/subtract values to the match points, advantages, and penalties.
